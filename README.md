User Management Screen UI Specification Document
Requirements:
-------------
The user management screen is designed to allow system administrators to manage users. The screen must meet the following requirements:

Display a list of existing users in a table format.
Allow the user to add new users to the system.
Allow the user to edit or delete existing users in the system.
Provide an easy-to-use and intuitive interface for performing user management tasks.
Ensure that only authorized system administrators have access to the user management screen.

UI Components:
-------------
The user management screen will consist of the following UI components:
User List Table 
The user list table will display a list of existing users in the system. Each row of the table will contain the following columns:

User Name
Email
Enabled
The table will be sortable by any of the columns.

Add User Form:
-------------
The add user form will allow system administrators to add new users to the system. The form will contain the following fields:

User Name
Display Name 
Phone
Email 
User Roles(Guest, Admin, SuperAdmin)
Enabled

Page Behavior:
-------------
When the user first loads the user management screen, the user list table will be displayed with all existing users in the system. The user can then add, save or hide enabled users as needed. The user list table will be sortable by any of the columns.

Access Control:
--------------
Only authorized system administrators will have access to the user management screen. Access to the screen will be controlled by a login system that verifies the user's identity and authorization level.

Conclusion:
-----------
The user management screen UI specification document outlines the requirements and UI components of the screen, as well as the page behavior and access control measures. This document will serve as a guide for software developers as they develop the user management screen.
